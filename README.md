# Audun Hilden 
:wave:  Hey there! I'm a **Front-End Engineer** and **UI** **Designer** with a total of **6-year experience** around developing and designing websites.
Mostly working with React and Next.js, but I'm also learning Vue.js and C#.

In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, communicating with people, or to just work on my personal projects.
